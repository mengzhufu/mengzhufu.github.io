I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Iowa where I earned my bachelorâ€™s degrees in Psychology and Music. I have a broad interest in human visual cognition, with a particular focus on studying different aspects of visual attention (e.g., attention in dynamic contexts, object-based attention, visual search, etc). My research uses a variety of behavioral methods, including eye tracking and virtual reality techniques.
