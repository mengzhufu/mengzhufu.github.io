I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2023. 

As a cognitive psychologist, I have a broad interest in human visual cognition, encompassing attention, perception, and memory. I am particularly interested in studying different aspects of visual attention (e.g., object-based attention, sustained attention, visual search, multiple-object tracking). I use a variety of behavioral methods, including eye tracking and virtual reality techniques in my research.
