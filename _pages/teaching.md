I consider teaching to be a crucial aspect of an academic's responsibility. Beyond giving students a good learning experience, I belieive teaching provides academics with a platform to hone their communication skills. it helps academics practice their communication skills. Sharing knowledge in a fun classroom setting is similar to presenting at conferences or discussing ideas with other researchers. It's all about effective communication.
